Markov: When clicked, it will invoke an automatic text generator like
the one you did in the last assignment. The text generator could be
trained with any file of your choice but it will be trained with
WarAndPeace.txt using linked lists as we did before. It should be able
to generate a new text based on an initial word and a number specifying
the length of the auto-generated text. The auto-generated text should
be displayed in the main text area, and the initial word and the length
should be provided by the user on a pop-up input dialog.
Truncate: When clicked, your program will invoke a method of yours to
truncate the file (War and Peace.txt)that is currently open in your text 
area into 20 subfiles. Each of the subfiles will contain from 5% to 100%
of the total number of words with an increment of 5% in each file. So
the first file will contain 5%, the second file will contain 10%, the third
file 15%, and so on, until 100% in the 20th file.
Show: When clicked, the program will display the results.txt file as
described below.
Plot: When clicked, your program will display the performance graph as
described below based on the 20 subfiles produced by the Truncate
menu item.
